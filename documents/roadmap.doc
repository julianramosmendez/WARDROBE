🌐 Phase 1: Requirements & Planning

1. Define Core Features

✅ User registration/login

✅ Upload clothing images (tops, pants, shoes, etc.)

✅ Categorize clothes (type, color, season, tags)

✅ View wardrobe gallery

✅ Create and view "Outfits" by linking clothing items

✅ Save outfits for future use

✅ Optional: Suggest outfits or detect duplicates using AI

2. Tools to Use for Planning

Diagrams: Figma
 or Draw.io

Task Board: Trello or Notion

Database Modeling: mongoDB

⚙️ Phase 2: Tech Stack Setup
📌 Recommended Tech Stack:
Layer	Tech	Why
Frontend	React (JS or TS)	Interactive UI, great ecosystem
Backend	Node.js + Express	Easy integration with React
Database	MongoDB or PostgreSQL	Mongo for flexible structure, Postgres for relational linking
Auth	Firebase Auth or Passport.js	Simple and secure auth systems
File Storage	Cloudinary or AWS S3	Store images efficiently
Linked List	Custom structure in Mongo/Postgres or in frontend state	To allow ordered outfit creation
Optional Tools

TailwindCSS: For styling

Redux/Zustand: For state management

Mongoose / Prisma: ORM/ODM for DB

Next.js (optional): Server-side rendering support

🧱 Phase 3: Database & Models

1. User

{
  _id,
  username,
  email,
  password_hash
}


2. ClothingItem

{
  _id,
  userId,
  imageUrl,
  type,          // e.g., "top", "shoes"
  tags: [],
  color,
  dateUploaded
}


3. Outfit — This is where you simulate a linked list:

{
  _id,
  userId,
  name,
  head: clothingItemId,   // first item in the outfit
  links: [
    { from: item1Id, to: item2Id },
    { from: item2Id, to: item3Id },
    ...
  ],
  dateCreated
}


You can also build the "linked list" logic client-side, representing the outfit as an array of linked items with "next" pointers if you want a strict linked list.

🧠 Phase 4: Backend API Design (Node.js + Express)

Endpoints to Implement:

POST /auth/signup / POST /auth/login

POST /upload → Handle image upload

GET /clothes → List all items for user

POST /outfits → Create an outfit

GET /outfits/:id → Get a linked list of items

DELETE /clothes/:id / DELETE /outfits/:id

Image Upload Flow

Image goes to Cloudinary/S3

URL saved in database along with metadata

💅 Phase 5: Frontend (React or Next.js)

Pages to Include:

Login / Signup

Wardrobe Gallery (Grid of uploaded clothes)

Upload Page (form + preview)

Outfit Creator (drag-drop or selection interface)

Outfit Viewer (visualize linked list structure)

Outfit Builder UI Example

Select item 1 → show preview

Select "add next" → pick item 2

Maintain a local linked list ([{id, nextId}])

Show a "chain" preview: Top → Pants → Shoes

You can use drag-and-drop libraries like:

react-beautiful-dnd or dnd-kit for arranging outfits

🔗 Phase 6: Simulating a Linked List

You can implement the linked list in one of two ways:

A. Backend-Persisted Linked List

Each Outfit stores links like:

"links": [
  { "from": "item123", "to": "item456" },
  { "from": "item456", "to": "item789" }
]


To retrieve the outfit, traverse starting at head, following the .to pointers.

B. Frontend-Only Linked List (JS structure)
const outfit = {
  head: "item123",
  nodes: {
    item123: { next: "item456" },
    item456: { next: "item789" },
    item789: { next: null }
  }
}


This can then be visualized or saved to the database.

🧪 Phase 7: Testing & Deployment

Testing Tools

Frontend: Jest + React Testing Library

Backend: Postman + Jest

Uploads: Mock S3/Cloudinary or use dev environment

Deployment Platforms

Frontend: Vercel / Netlify

Backend: Railway / Render / Fly.io

Database: MongoDB Atlas / Supabase / Neon

File Storage: Cloudinary (free tier is good!)

🔄 Phase 8: Stretch Features (optional)

AI Suggestions: Use OpenAI/Replicate API to suggest outfits

Style Analyzer: Recommend based on color theory

Outfit Calendar: Plan looks for the week

Shareable Outfits: Generate public links or images

✅ Final Thoughts
Languages to Learn/Use:

JavaScript/TypeScript: For frontend & backend

HTML/CSS (Tailwind): UI styling

MongoDB or SQL: For data modeling

Cloudinary/AWS SDK: For file upload

Basic Git/GitHub: For collaboration/versioning

Would you like me to scaffold out a basic file structure and starter code for this?
